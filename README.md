Project Title: Expanding Cards with Click Effect
This project is a simple and interactive UI feature built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a set of image panels that expand when clicked.

ðŸŸ¢ How it works:

Multiple image panels are shown side by side.

When you click on any panel, it expands smoothly, while the previously active panel automatically collapses.

Only one panel remains active at a time, making the interface clean and user-friendly.

The design is responsive and hides extra panels on smaller screens (like mobile devices).

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

HTML

CSS (with transitions for smooth animation)

JavaScript (for adding/removing active class)
